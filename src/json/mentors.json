Make it easy for them by sending your resume, email address, relevant links, and a casual blurb selling yourself (as if you were in their shoes recommending yourself). Best means of getting your foot in the door is to do this research early and ask your contact to send your resume to the recruiter/hiring manager through their internal means of communication (Slack, company email, etc). This will make your application bubble up rather than getting lost in the application system. 2. https://2by22.blog/definitive-guide-to-behavioral-interview-questions/ A great supplement to Decode and Conquer about acing the behavioral interview questions and leaving an impression with your interviewer. 3. https://www.keyvalues.com/culture-queries End your interview on a strong note by asking the questions that matter to you and show you value culture.",
